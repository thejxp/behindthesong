## Behind The Song

Behind the Song is a project that facilitates discovery of music through songwriters, producers, etc,
rather than just those who performed the song. By calling attention to and share appreciation for the
powerhouses behind the songs we love we hope to give more recognition to those who are behind the song,
not just the performer.

In addition, we tend to discover songs by following artists and seeing similar ones. However, an artist is often far
from being the only individual involved in the creation of music.

Although the sounds of the music we enjoy are intrinsically tied to and largely defined by the performers/artists,
there's also the producer, the lyricist, and so many others than ultimately help create the final product.
Many of your favorite songs from different artists might have been written by the same person, or had a similar production team.
Of course, there's substantial overlap in these categories, and there are many artists who fill all these roles.
